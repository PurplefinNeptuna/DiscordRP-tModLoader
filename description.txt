This mod add a little extra detail of your ingame terraria activity to your discord status.

Displayed info:

Developers can use modcall to add mod boss and biome to Rich Presence.

Rich Presence assets can only be added by the owner (Me),
so you can contact me on Discord (Neptuna#3678) to put your asset in Rich Presence.

Because the assets storage is limited, I might remove less popular mod's asset in
favor of more popular mod.
